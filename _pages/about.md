Hey! <br>
I'm Jelle, a motiondesigner working at [Create.eu](https://create.eu) and living in Ghent, Belgium. <br><br>
As in my personal life, I take function over form. The story is what matters!<br>
I tell narratives with clear design, deliberate movements and loads of character. <br>
To accomplish this I love to experiment within the broad range of motion design: 2D, 3D, projection mapping, immersive installations, interactive design,...<br>
Whatever the story needs!

Have a story to tell? [Let me know!]({{site.baseurl}}/contact)
