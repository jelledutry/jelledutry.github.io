    <p>This was my final exercise for the course Audiovisual Arts and Productions.</p>

    <p>It is a kind of complaint against the need for constant connection.</p>

    <p>The focus of this video was the light. I tried to tell the story with as little movement as possible. Only the light is constantly changing and slips across the screen.</p>

    <p>The whole video is made by me, the illustrations animations and audio.</p>
