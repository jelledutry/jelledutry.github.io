This cute little crab was created for a school assignment. We had to integrate a 3D object in some filmed footage.  

I got a bit ambitious and wanted to create a 3D character. Without any 3D animation experience or any notion of rigging I created this fella. The first animation attempt, below, explains the struggle better then I ever could.
