A little loop I made to practice transitions and combining 2D & 3D animation.  
I like the different framerates between the skater and the skateboard. It makes the animation more snappy but keeps the flow of the flip.  

In the final composit I added some lens distortion on the skate part. This matches the look of skateclips using fisheye lenses. It exagerates the motion and makes it look bigger. Animating the lens distortion in and out enhanced this even further.  
It's subtle but it's there.
